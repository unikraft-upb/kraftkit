Kraftkit is a suite of tools and framework for building custom, minimal, immutable lightweight virtual machines based on [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org).
With Kraftkitt, you can use unikernels at every of their lifecycle: from construction to production.

You can quickly and easily install KraftKit using the interactive installer.  Simply run the following command to get started: 

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

Alternatively you can download the binaries from the [releases pages](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases).

## Quick-start

Building a unikernel with KraftKit is designed to be simple, simply add a `Kraftfile` to your project directory, which specifies the libraries needed for your unikernel:

```yaml
specification: v0.5

unikraft: stable

libraries:
  newlib: stable

targets:
  - name: default
    architecture: x86_64
    platform: kvm
```

You can also add an additional `Makefile.uk` which specifies any source files:

```Makefile
$(eval $(call addlib,apphelloworld))

APPHELLOWORLD_SRCS-y += $(APPHELLOWORLD_BASE)/main.c
```

Then it is a case of running:

```shell
cd path/to/workdir

kraft pkg update
kraft build
```

You can run your unikernel using:

```shell
kraft run
```
